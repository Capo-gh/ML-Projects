# Crop Recommendation System

## Overview
Built a classification model to help farmers select the best crop based on soil conditions.

## Data
Soil measurements including:
- Nitrogen content
- Phosphorous content
- Potassium content
- pH value
- Optimal crop (target)

## What I Did
1. Explored the relationship between soil metrics and crops
2. Built a multi-class classification model
3. Identified the most important soil feature

## Results
Created a model that can recommend suitable crops based on soil measurements.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
