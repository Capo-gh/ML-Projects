# Penguin Species Clustering

# Overview
Used K-means clustering to identify three penguin species in Antarctica based on physical measurements.

## Data
Measurements from penguins including:
- Culmen length and depth
- Flipper length
- Body mass
- Sex

## What I Did
1. Cleaned the data and removed missing values
2. Applied K-means clustering with 3 clusters
3. Analyzed the average measurements of each cluster
4. Visualized the results

## Results
Found three distinct clusters that likely correspond to Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguin species.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
