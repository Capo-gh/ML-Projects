# Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Overview
Implementation of logistic regression from scratch applied to two datasets: Antibiotics Resistance and Insurance Claims. The project includes data preparation, model training, cross-validation, and feature importance analysis.

## Key Features
- Custom logistic regression implementation without using sklearn
- K-fold cross-validation for model evaluation
- Feature importance analysis
- Learning rate optimization
- Creation of interaction features

## Datasets
- Antibiotics Resistance: Binary classification to predict antibiotic resistance
- Insurance Claims: Binary classification to detect anomalous insurance claims

## Techniques
- Data normalization
- Model selection through cross-validation
- Feature subset selection
