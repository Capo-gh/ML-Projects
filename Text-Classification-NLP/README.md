## Features
- Custom Enhanced Bernoulli Naive Bayes implementation
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- City-specific feature extraction
- Cross-validation evaluation
- Comparison with Random Forest classifier

## Techniques
- Binary bag-of-words representation
- N-gram extraction
- Adaptive smoothing
- Class weighting for imbalanced data

## Results
The project compares performance between a custom Naive Bayes implementation and Random Forest, selecting the best performer for final predictions.
